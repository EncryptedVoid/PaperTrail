PaperTrail Main Processing Pipeline

Complete document processing pipeline with session tracking, conversion, sanitization,
metadata extraction, semantic analysis, and database tabulation with encryption.

This is the main entry point for the PaperTrail system, orchestrating a multi-stage
document processing workflow that takes raw artifacts and processes them through
various stages until they are ready for storage and retrieval.

# SYSTEM INITIALIZATION
# ============================================================================

for directory in SYSTEM_DIRECTORIES:

# LOGGING CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# WORKFLOW OVERVIEW:
# ------------------
# This project manages secure file storage and sharing using Tresorit as the cloud backend.
# Files are stored cloud-only (no local sync) and tracked in a local spreadsheet.
# Share links are generated on-demand with security controls (passwords, expiration, tracking).
#
# TRESORIT FEATURES USED:
# -----------------------
# - Cloud-only storage (Tresors) - files stay in cloud, no auto-sync to devices
# - Manual file uploads via desktop/mobile apps
# - Share links with granular security controls:
#   * Password protection (set custom password per link)
#   * Expiration dates (set exact day/time when link becomes invalid)
#   * Download limits (limit number of times file can be downloaded)
#   * Email verification (force recipients to verify email before access)
#   * Access logs (track who opened link: IP, date/time, platform, email)
#   * Instant revocation (kill link anytime, even after sharing)
# - iOS/iPad apps for mobile link generation
# - Zero-knowledge end-to-end encryption (Tresorit can't access files)
# - SOC 2, ISO 27001 certified, Ernst & Young security audited
# - 14 years in business, zero data breaches
#
# MANUAL WORKFLOW:
# ----------------
# 1. Upload files to Tresorit via desktop app or mobile
# 2. Update this local spreadsheet with file metadata:
#    - File name
#    - Description/tags for searching
#    - Tresorit folder path
#    - Date uploaded
#    - [Placeholder for share link - added when generated]
#
# 3. When sharing is needed:
#    a. Search spreadsheet to find required file
#    b. Open Tresorit (desktop, web, or iOS/iPad app)
#    c. Navigate to file and create share link with security settings:
#       - Set password (share password via separate channel)
#       - Set expiration date (when file access should end)
#       - Enable download tracking/access logs
#       - Optionally: set download limit or require email verification
#    d. Copy generated link
#    e. Update spreadsheet with link URL
#    f. Copy prepared description + link for email/document sharing
#
# 4. Monitoring:
#    - Check Tresorit access logs to see who downloaded what and when
#    - Revoke links if needed
#    - Links auto-expire based on set dates
#
# SPREADSHEET SCHEMA (suggested columns):
# ----------------------------------------
# - file_id: Unique identifier for tracking
# - file_name: Original filename
# - description: Searchable description/tags
# - tresorit_path: Folder location in Tresorit (e.g., "/Contracts/2025/")
# - upload_date: When file was uploaded
# - file_type: PDF, DOCX, etc.
# - share_link: Tresorit share link URL (added when generated)
# - link_password: Password set on link (store securely!)
# - link_expiration: Expiration date/time set on link
# - link_created_date: When share link was generated
# - notes: Additional metadata
#
# EXAMPLE SHARING TEXT TEMPLATE:
# ------------------------------
# {description}
# Format: {file_type}
# Access expires: {link_expiration}
# Secure link: {share_link}
# (Password sent separately)
#
# LIMITATIONS (NO API):
# ---------------------
# - No programmatic file listing
# - No automated link generation
# - No automated upload via scripts
# - All operations must be done manually through Tresorit apps/web interface
# - This spreadsheet must be manually maintained
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
# ---------------
# - Store link passwords separately from links (different communication channel)
# - Review access logs regularly
# - Set expiration dates on all sensitive links
# - Revoke links immediately when no longer needed
# - Use email verification for highly sensitive documents
# - Enable 2FA on Tresorit account
#
# VERSION HISTORY:
# ----------------
# - Tresorit keeps last 10 file versions (on 1TB plan)
# - Can restore previous versions if needed
# - Deleted files recoverable for retention period

# TODO: Functions for spreadsheet management
# - add_file_entry(file_name, description, tresorit_path, ...)
# - search_files(keyword)
# - update_share_link(file_id, link_url, password, expiration)
# - generate_sharing_text(file_id)
# - mark_link_revoked(file_id)
manual_backup(
    logger=logger,  # Pass logger for tracking database insertion activities
    source_dir=TABULATED_DIR,  # Input: documents with all processing complete
    failure_dir=FAILED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: documents that fail database insertion
    success_dir=COMPLETED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: fully processed documents ready for use
)

# ============================================================================
# PIPELINE COMPLETION
# ============================================================================
# Log successful completion of entire processing pipeline
# All documents have been processed through all seven stages and are ready for use
logger.info("All processing stages completed successfully!")
