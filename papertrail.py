PaperTrail Main Processing Pipeline

Complete document processing pipeline with session tracking, conversion, sanitization,
metadata extraction, semantic analysis, and database tabulation with encryption.

This is the main entry point for the PaperTrail system, orchestrating a multi-stage
document processing workflow that takes raw artifacts and processes them through
various stages until they are ready for storage and retrieval.

# SYSTEM INITIALIZATION
# ============================================================================

# Ensure all required directories exist before processing begins
# This prevents errors during processing if any directory is missing
# parents=True creates parent directories if needed, exist_ok=True prevents errors if already exists
for directory in SYSTEM_DIRECTORIES:
    directory.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# ============================================================================
# LOGGING CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# Generate a unique log file name for this session using timestamp
# Format: prefix-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log
# This ensures each run has its own log file for auditing and debugging
log_file_name = (
    f"{SESSION_LOG_FILE_PREFIX}-{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')}.log"
)

# Setup dual logging: console output for real-time monitoring and file output for persistence
# Console handler allows operators to monitor progress in real-time
# File handler creates a permanent record of all processing activities
handlers = [
    logging.StreamHandler(),  # Outputs log messages to console/terminal
    logging.FileHandler(
        (LOG_DIR / log_file_name),  # Outputs log messages to timestamped file
        encoding="utf-8",  # Ensures proper handling of international characters
    ),
]

# Configure the root logger with INFO level and custom format
# INFO level captures important events without excessive debug details
# Format includes timestamp, logger name, severity level, and the actual message
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,  # Set minimum logging level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
    format="%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",  # Structured log format
    handlers=handlers,  # Apply both console and file handlers

)

# ============================================================================
# STAGE 1: SANITIZATION
# ============================================================================
# First processing stage: validate and clean incoming documents
# This stage checks for malware, enforces file type restrictions, validates formats,
# and ensures documents meet security requirements before further processing
# Documents that pass move to SANITIZED_ARTIFACTS_DIR, failures go to FAILED_ARTIFACTS_DIR
sanitize(
    logger=logger,  # Pass logger for tracking sanitization activities
    source_dir=UNPROCESSED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Input: raw, unprocessed documents
    failure_dir=FAILED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: documents that fail sanitization
    success_dir=SANITIZED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: clean, validated documents
)

# ============================================================================
# STAGE 2: METADATA EXTRACTION
# ============================================================================
# Second processing stage: extract document metadata and properties
# This stage reads embedded metadata like author, creation date, modification history,
# document properties, and other file attributes for indexing and searchability
# Extracted metadata is stored alongside documents for later database insertion
extract_metadata(
    logger=logger,  # Pass logger for tracking metadata extraction activities
    source_dir=SANITIZED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Input: sanitized documents from previous stage
    failure_dir=FAILED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: documents where metadata extraction fails
    success_dir=METADATA_EXTRACTED_DIR,  # Output: documents with extracted metadata
)

# ============================================================================
# STAGE 3: FORMAT CONVERSION
# ============================================================================
# Third processing stage: convert documents to standardized formats
# This stage normalizes different file formats (DOCX, XLSX, images, etc.) into
# consistent formats for downstream processing (typically PDF and/or plain text)
# Original files are archived, converted versions proceed to next stage
convert(
    logger=logger,  # Pass logger for tracking conversion activities
    source_dir=METADATA_EXTRACTED_DIR,  # Input: documents with extracted metadata
    failure_dir=FAILED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: documents that fail conversion
    archive_dir=ARCHIVAL_DIR,  # Output: original files archived for preservation
    success_dir=CONVERTED_ARTIFACT_DIR,  # Output: standardized format documents
)

# ============================================================================
# STAGE 3.5: DOCUMENT EMBELLISHMENT
# ============================================================================
# Intermediate processing stage: enhance documents with additional formatting
# This stage applies visual improvements, adds watermarks, adjusts layouts,
# or enriches documents with supplementary metadata or styling
# Documents are enhanced without changing their core content
embellish(
    logger=logger,  # Pass logger for tracking embellishment activities
    source_dir=CONVERTED_ARTIFACT_DIR,  # Input: converted documents in standard format
    failure_dir=FAILED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: documents where embellishment fails
    success_dir=EMBELLISHED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: enhanced documents with improved presentation
)

# ============================================================================
# STAGE 4: SEMANTIC EXTRACTION
# ============================================================================
# Fourth processing stage: perform semantic analysis and content understanding
# This stage analyzes document content to extract meaning, identify key concepts,
# classify document types, extract entities, and build searchable semantic indexes
# Results enable intelligent search and retrieval beyond simple keyword matching
extract_semantics(
    logger=logger,  # Pass logger for tracking semantic analysis activities
    source_dir=EMBELLISHED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Input: embellished documents with improved formatting
    failure_dir=FAILED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: documents where semantic analysis fails
    success_dir=SEMANTICS_EXTRACTED_DIR,  # Output: documents with semantic annotations
)

# ============================================================================
# STAGE 5: TRANSLATION
# ============================================================================
# Fifth processing stage: translate documents to target languages
# This stage performs language detection and translation of document content
# to one or more target languages for multi-lingual accessibility
# Translation preserves formatting and structure while converting text content
translate(
    logger=logger,  # Pass logger for tracking translation activities
    source_dir=SEMANTICS_EXTRACTED_DIR,  # Input: documents with semantic annotations
    failure_dir=FAILED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: documents where translation fails
    success_dir=TRANSLATED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: documents in target languages
)

# ============================================================================
# STAGE 6: PASSWORD PROTECTION
# ============================================================================
# Sixth processing stage: apply encryption and password protection
# This stage secures documents by adding password protection, applying encryption,
# and setting access restrictions to ensure confidentiality
# Protected documents can only be accessed with proper credentials
password_protect(
    logger=logger,  # Pass logger for tracking password protection activities
    source_dir=TRANSLATED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Input: translated documents
    failure_dir=FAILED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: documents where protection fails
    success_dir=PROTECTED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: password-protected and encrypted documents
)

# ============================================================================
# STAGE 7: DATABASE TABULATION
# ============================================================================
# Final processing stage: organize data into database with encryption
# This stage takes all extracted information (metadata, semantics, content) and
# structures it into database records with proper encryption for sensitive fields
# Successfully tabulated documents move to COMPLETED_ARTIFACTS_DIR, ready for storage
tabulate(
    logger=logger,  # Pass logger for tracking database insertion activities
    source_dir=PROTECTED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Input: documents with all processing complete
    failure_dir=FAILED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: documents that fail database insertion
    success_dir=COMPLETED_ARTIFACTS_DIR,  # Output: fully processed documents ready for use
)

# ============================================================================
# PIPELINE COMPLETION
# ============================================================================
# Log successful completion of entire processing pipeline
# All documents have been processed through all seven stages and are ready for use
logger.info("All processing stages completed successfully!")
