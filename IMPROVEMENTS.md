## **1. Configuration Hell (Critical)**

Your `papertrail.py` has hardcoded paths, model names, and settings scattered everywhere. This makes it impossible for users to customize without editing source code. You need a proper config file system (YAML/JSON) where users can set:

- Base directories
- Model preferences
- Hardware limits
- Processing settings
- Supported file types

## **2. Monolithic Main Script (High Priority)**

Your `papertrail.py` is 1000+ lines doing everything. It should be broken into:

- `PipelineOrchestrator` class that coordinates stages
- Individual stage classes (`DuplicateDetector`, `MetadataExtractor`, etc.)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper dependency injection

## **3. Dependency Nightmare (Critical)**

No `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`. Users have no idea what to install. You need:

- Pinned dependency versions
- Optional dependencies clearly marked
- Installation instructions
- Virtual environment setup guide

## **4. Error Recovery (High Priority)**

If processing fails on file 500 of 1000, users start over completely. You need:

- Stage checkpointing
- Resume capability
- Graceful failure handling
- Partial result preservation

## **5. Input Validation (High Priority)**

Almost no validation of:

- File paths exist
- Hardware requirements met
- OLLAMA running and accessible
- Models available
- Disk space sufficient

## **6. Resource Leaks (Medium-High)**

GPU memory and file handles aren't always cleaned up properly. You need:

- Context managers for all resources
- Proper cleanup in exception paths
- Memory monitoring and automatic cleanup

## **7. CLI Interface (Medium)**

Currently just a script. Should have proper CLI with:

- Command line arguments
- Progress bars
- Status reporting
- Different operation modes

## **8. Logging Inconsistency (Medium)**

Different modules log differently. Standardize:

- Log formats
- Log levels
- Progress reporting
- Error context

## **9. Performance Reporting (Medium)**

You collect stats but don't present them well. Users need:

- Real-time progress dashboard
- Performance summaries
- Bottleneck identification
- Hardware utilization metrics

## **10. Type Safety (Low-Medium)**

Inconsistent type hints make the code harder to maintain and debug.
